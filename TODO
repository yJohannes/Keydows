- IDEAS:
- something better than locking the ยง key

- FIX:
- Can't click while ยง key is down
- Hotkey keys not releasing

- COREAPP:
- GUI

- OVERLAY:
- Use VK instead of wchars 
- Adjustable alpha for text
- Overlay uses GetKeyboardState instead of the ll hook state
- Make holding input key hold click and arrows move the cursor

- SMOOTH NAVIGATE:
- ยง + enter click
- Alt drag type of thing
