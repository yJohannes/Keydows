- GENERAL:
- Fix hotkey stuff

- COREAPP:
- GUI

- TOOLS:
- Use VK instead of wchars 
- Adjustable alpha for text (after everything else)
- Overlay uses GetKeyboardState instead of the ll hook state
- Let hotkey mod keys pass the hook (MAYBE?)
- Make holding input key hold click and arrows move cursor
